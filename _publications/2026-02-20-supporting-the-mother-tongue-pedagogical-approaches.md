Abstract

This paper reports on the development and evaluation of a project to support the learning of the

mother tongue by children aged 4–8 years. The aim of the project was to: actively involve and

engage children with learning their mother tongue for functional use; involve parents in the learn-

ing process and support them in doing so; and increase children’s regular attendance at the

educational setting where formal teaching of the mother tongue takes place. A program entitled

‘Learning Together’ was developed, drawing on the principles of socio-cultural theory and devel-

opmentally appropriate practice that underpin the pedagogical praxis in early childhood. The

program was implemented in a Greek community school located in England. The project

followed an ethnographic case-study methodology. Its findings are discussed in terms of the

implications for pedagogical approaches and practices that might be applicable in similar contexts

and situations.
