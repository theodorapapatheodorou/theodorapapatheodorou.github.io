<p style="text-align: justify">This article aims to explore relational pedagogy, as an applied concept in early childhood education and care (ECEC), based on relevant literature published during the first quarter of the 21st century. For this, two broad questions posed, that is, (i) how has relational pedagogy in ECEC been conceptualised over time? (ii) what are some of the key issues surrounding its implementation? Based on a synthesis of key ideas from relevant literature, relational pedagogy in ECEC is conceptualised as a complex web of children’s relationship formation with others, be it with educators and peers, and includes relationships and connections made with the content/materials, and with the context/place of the educational activities, and the processes involved. It also includes children’s relationships and connections made with their wider social and natural/more than human world, beyond the confines of ECEC settings and the educational activities.</p><p style="text-align: justify">Relational pedagogy is underpinned by four constituent elements, namely, (i) the affective states of both children and their educators, (ii) the dialogical, verbal and especially non-verbal communicative exchanges and interactions, (iii) the educators’ pedagogical and subject knowledge and (iv) a conducive learning environment. A spiritual dimension also emerges especially for relational pedagogy understood in terms of relationship formation with the natural environment. Play and especially joyful play emerges as the powerful platform for enacting relational pedagogy. Despite the increased understanding of relational pedagogies in ECEC, its implementation is largely enabled or constrained by institutional priorities and organisational structural parameters, and institutional confidence and emotional support offered to educators. This in turn enables or undermines the confidence of ECEC educators to engage with relational pedagogy.</p><p style="text-align: justify"><strong>Keywords: </strong>Relational pedagogy, play, joyful, affective, embodied, dialogical.</p>
