This study explored the qualities of home-based childcare in England from the perspectives of qualified nannies and registered childminders. An initial framing of key characteristics and qualities of home-based childcare was drawn from extant literature. An online questionnaire was developed and distributed among members of professional networks. This resulted in 99 full responses from qualified nannies and registered childminders based in England, with a total of 856 individual replies across the 20 items of the questionnaire. The questionnaire was followed up with an online focus group discussion in which six nannies participated. Thematic analyses of the questionnaire and focus group data were synthesised to identify overarching themes and their sub-themes. The findings of this study corroborated previous research findings revealing that home-based childcare is a flexible and affordable service that enables parental employment, serves as a parental substitute, nurtures child wellbeing and promotes learning. It is underpinned by strong relationships, a distinct pedagogy and unique structural and contextual qualities. This study also offers further insights into the personal attributes of home-based educarers and their role as professional knowledge brokers, supporting parents with their parenting and with personal and family challenges. As such, home-based childcare is conceptualised as a support system for families, which goes beyond caring for children.

Keywords: home-based childcare, qualities, characteristics, support system, knowledge brokering
