**Description** - Relational pedagogy underpins the core principles of both the cognitive, and social/emotional development of young children, as evidenced in the Reggio Emilia preschools and the Te Whariki curriculum in New Zealand. Emphasising the links between, people, places and ideas and the effects of these on education, educators and learners, it is integral to the _English Early Years Foundation Stage_, and forms the basis for early years provision around the world.

<p style="text-align: justify">This book brings together contributions from international experts on early years education to explore and debate relational pedagogy across different countries and in the context of a broad international field. The three sections of the book cover the following areas:</p>

*   culture, environment and adult child relationships - how children and adults relate to the culture, ethos and environment in which they function;
    
*   adult-child relationships - how education and care environments directly relate to learning and teaching;
    
*   adult-adult relationships for professional development - in training situations and parental partnerships.
    

<p style="text-align: justify">The book will be of interest to all those who want to delve deeper into how these interactions affect teaching and learning and to understand how the context can have its own impact on pedagogical outcomes. Researchers in early years education and students on early childhood education courses will find much here to inspire and challenge their thinking.</p>
