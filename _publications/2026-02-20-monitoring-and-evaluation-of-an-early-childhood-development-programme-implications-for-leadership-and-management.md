**Abstract** - The article aims to discuss preliminary findings from a participatory monitoring and evaluation (M&E) framework, used in a community-based early childhood development (ECD) programme in KwaZulu-Natal South Africa, and their implications for leadership and management. The purposes of the M&E were for LETCEE, the implementing organization, to enhance its own learning and M&E systems, and to gather data for use by the funding body to advocate for alternative ECD programmes. A participatory M&E framework was used, adopting a case study design, to collect both qualitative and quantitative data from multiple sources. Thematic analysis and statistical analysis were employed for qualitative and quantitative data, respectively. Emerging issues from data analysis included: use of data beyond accountability to funders; new learnings for all those involved with M&E; and informing decision-making and planning. The implications of these findings are discussed for the organization’s leadership and management.
